spatial_feature_selection
========================

This project contains the data used for our research paper about feature selection for spatially relevant features. In order to be able to reproduce the results from the Wikipedia evaluation carried out in the paper, we here provide the testfile we used.

The contents of this project are:
* features.txt - A sorted list of 301 968 features used in the paper
* testfile.tar.gz - A compressed version of the Wikipedia testfile used in the paper

### Test set

The testfile contains 21 839 Wikipedia documents annotated with geographical coordinates that are located within a bounding box of the United Kingdom. This set of documents was constructed to contain only entities that can be considered as a certain location or spot.

### Questions
